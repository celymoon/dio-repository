<h1>Instagram simple clone</h1>

<p>For this clone I worked only with a simple query for max-width of 825px and an other max-width of 1500px. Here are the images of the code so far: </p>

<h3>Page with 825 (or so) max-width:</h3>

<p>Later I will add the slide of the pitch, but as far as this project is foccused on pure flex-box css and html, this won't be my priority for now. <br> 
Hope you enjoy this project, feel free to send me your feedback.

Wish you a very nice day. <br>
